## Total Duration: 30 seconds
## Voice: Grandpa Spuds Oxley (Exaggerated, Grumpy → Sweet)

---

## [0-3 sec] HOOK
**[Meme: Grumpy old man face - center, medium]**

**GRANDPA:**
"[heavy sigh] Alright, ALRIGHT. I'm up. [grumbles] Thirty-eight-year-old woman. Can't breathe. Vision's blurry. Calcium's at 11.2—that's HIGH, by the way. [annoyed] What's causin' this disaster?"

**Tone:** Like you just woke him from a nap, extremely put out

---

## [3-8 sec] SETUP - The Clues
**[Visual: Vignette text appears word by word]**
**[Meme at 5 sec: Nodding approval (Obama/SpongeBob) - tiny, bottom right corner]**

**GRANDPA:**
"[muttering] Look at this... She's got ankle pain, these red bumps on her shins—erythema nodosum, fancy name for nothin'—her eyes are inflamed, chest X-ray shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. [voice dripping with sarcasm] Ohhh, and they did a biopsy. Noncaseating granulomas. How lovely."

**Tone:** Rattling off like reading junk mail, zero enthusiasm

---

## [8-11 sec] LAB SPOTLIGHT
**[Visual: Lab box slides up]**
**[Meme at 9 sec: Stonks guy - small, bottom right]**

**GRANDPA:**
"[scoffs] And get THIS—calcium's at 11.2! Normal's 8.5 to 10. So her calcium's goin' UP while her lungs are goin' DOWN. [dismissive laugh] Don't make sense, does it?"

**Tone:** Almost laughing at how dumb this sounds

---

## [11-14 sec] THE QUESTION
**[Visual: Question box pulses in, options appear]**

**GRANDPA:**
"So which mechanism explains it? A? B? C? D? E? [pause] Go ahead. Take a guess. I got all day. [clearly lying, very impatient]"

**Tone:** Challenging, like "I DARE you to get this wrong"

---

## [14-17 sec] THE PAUSE
**[Visual: Freeze frame, options displayed]**
**[Meme at 15 sec: Confused math lady - CENTER, large]**

**GRANDPA:**
"[silence] ...Still waitin'. [taps something] Ticktock. [heavy sigh] You're overthinking it."

**Tone:** Foot-tapping energy, about to fall asleep waiting

---

## [17-20 sec] REVEAL
**[Visual: Option C glows, others fade]**
**[Meme at 18 sec: Disappointed cricket fan - bottom right, small]**

**GRANDPA:**
"[not surprised] It's C. Of COURSE it's C. Increased 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity. [muttering] Nobody ever picks C..."

**Tone:** "I knew you'd get it wrong" but resigned

---

## [20-28 sec] TEACHING MOMENT (REVISED - SHORTER)
**[Visual: Key teaching point overlays at 22 sec]**
**[Meme at 25 sec: Leo DiCaprio pointing - small, bottom left]**

**GRANDPA:**
"[reluctant teaching mode] Alright, LISTEN. Sarcoidosis makes granulomas. Those granulomas activate vitamin D with 1-alpha-hydroxylase. More active vitamin D means the gut grabs MORE calcium. [slight chuckle] So her lungs are a mess, but calcium goes UP. Backwards, right?

[voice softens] Look, this stuff's confusing. That's why they test it. If you want more breakdowns like this, check out SynapticRecall. Makes it easier."

**Tone shift:** Grumpy → Teaching → Brief caring moment

---

## [28-30 sec] OUTRO
**GRANDPA:**
"[back to grumpy] Now go study. I got a crossword to finish."

**Tone:** Dismissive grandpa, back to his regular programming
