  "script": "GOOD LORD ALMIGHTY. Seventeen year old kid. Motorcycle accident. Smacks his head HARD. Loses consciousness for maybe THIRTY SECONDS. Then wakes up. Seems FINE. Parents are RELIEVED. They dodged a bullet. Or so they think.\nKid's talking. Laughing. Says he feels OKAY. Maybe a headache. Doctor wants to keep him. Parents say no we're taking him HOME. Two hours later, kid starts SLURRING his words. Gets DROWSY. Then SEIZES. Pupils BLOWN wide open like dinner plates. One side BIGGER than the other. Heart's SLOW. Blood pressure through the ROOF. Kid's DYING.\nCT scan lights up. Big white LENS SHAPED blob. RIGHT here between the skull and the brain. Blood BUILDING UP like a BALLOON inflating. SQUISHING the brain against the skull.\nWhat artery got RIPPED? A? Anterior cerebral. B? Middle cerebral. C? Middle meningeal. D? Posterior cerebral. E? Vertebral. Clock's TICKING and this kid's got MINUTES.\nC. And I ALREADY KNOW half you clicked middle cerebral because it SOUNDS more important. WRONG. You just murdered a kid. Middle MENINGEAL. The one that runs through the skull like plumbing in your walls. Skull cracks, pipe bursts, kid's TOAST.\nHere's the part they DON'T show you on Grey's Anatomy. That skull fracture CRACKED the temporal bone like cheap CHINA. Middle meningeal artery runs in GROOVES inside that bone. Like wiring in your walls. Fracture TEARS it wide open. Arterial blood SPRAYS at high pressure. Builds FAST. That's your lucid interval. Kid seems fine. Brain's getting PANCAKED against the skull. By the time symptoms show, MINUTES before the brainstem HERNIATES down through the hole and it's GAME OVER. You're drilling a hole in his skull at 2 AM PRAYING you're not too late.\nHere's your pearl. Lucid interval plus lens shaped bleed equals epidural hematoma. NEVER send a head trauma patient home without imaging.\nNow SKEDADDLE before I lose my temper.",

Witnesses report he was unconscious for approximately 30 seconds before regaining consciousness. On arrival, he is alert and oriented, GCS 15, with only a mild headache. His parents request to take him home. Two hours after being discharged against medical advice, paramedics are called to his home. He is now lethargic with slurred speech. He has a tonic-clonic seizure en route to the hospital.",
