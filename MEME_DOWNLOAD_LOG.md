## File Formats Downloaded

### Animated GIFs

## Sources Used

Primary sources for direct image URLs:
- **Know Your Meme (i.kym-cdn.com)**: 35 memes
- **Imgflip (i.imgflip.com)**: 8 memes
- **GIPHY (media.giphy.com)**: 5 memes
- **Tenor**: 2 memes

## Notable Challenges

1. **URL Resolution**: Many URLs in the source JSON were template pages, not direct image links. Had to use WebFetch and WebSearch to find actual CDN URLs.

2. **GIF Sources**: GIFs required finding actual media CDN URLs from Giphy, Tenor, and other platforms rather than just gallery pages.

3. **Failed Downloads**: Some initial URLs returned HTML error pages (243-263 bytes). These were re-downloaded with correct URLs.

## File Location

All memes are stored in:
- **Directory**: `/Users/haziq/synaptic-recall-ads/src/assets/memes/`
- **Library JSON**: `/Users/haziq/synaptic-recall-ads/src/assets/memes/meme-library.json`

## Meme Library JSON Structure

The `meme-library.json` file contains metadata for each meme:
```json
{
  "meme-id": {
    "name": "Meme Name",
    "category": "disaster_shock",
    "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
    "use_case": "Medical education use case description",
    "local_path": "memes/meme-id.jpg",
    "downloaded": true
  }
}
```

## Quality Metrics

- **Largest**: 9.7MB (grumpy-old-man.gif)

### Resolution Quality
All images are suitable for video production:
